It's first time I want to start a project with full of coding masters' help. 

Why so many people like contributing to community like Github or Dribbble? I think the reason is an old classic word "making a better world", so here I want to do is not writing a better code, making a better architecture or something like that. Just make a better work by standing on the shoulder of giants.
